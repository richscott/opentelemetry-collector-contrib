  Introduces the `tags_from_imds` boolean field in the EC2 detector configuration.
  When set to `true`, instance tags are fetched via IMDS, which does not require any IAM
  permissions but requires `InstanceMetadataTags=enabled` on the instance.
  When set to `false` (default), tags are fetched via the EC2 `DescribeTags` API,
  which requires the `ec2:DescribeTags` IAM permission. This is the existing behavior and
  the default to avoid breaking changes.
